# Web-APIs-Challenge-Code-Quiz
This weeks assingment i was asked to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions using JavaScript,HTML, and CSS to write my code.
The motive behind this challange is to help user students become more competent coders. This quiz will allow users to measure their understanding of JavaScript. A user can record their scores and compare their scores to previous attempts to see how the did. Users have the ability to also record their initials and compare it to others players attempt at the quiz on the same device.fundamentals that stores high scores so i can gauge my progress compared to my peers and other players.
My site is live at https://afrema90.github.io/Web-APIs-Challenge-Code-Quiz/
you start the game by pressing the start button. This will start the timer and present the first question. A player can select from four options a,b,c,d. When an option is selected the next question is presented. The user is also shown if the previous answer is correct or incorrect underneath the question. If the previous question is answered incorrectly ten seconds is reduced from the time remaining. After the last question or when the timer hits zero the player is presented with their score and an opportunity to record their initials and final score. As i was playing i relized that the questions where in the order and number all the time so i looked up a way to make it a little diffrent each time a player played it so i Randomize the question selection. so basically the games will be the same questions but will show up randomly.
A photo of the mockup is available below.
